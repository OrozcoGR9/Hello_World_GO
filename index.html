    <h1>My First Webpage!</h1>
    <p>Hello World! This is my webpage, I hope that you will like it!</p>

     <p> This website is an interesting experiment. It is a full screen adventure that requires headphones. The screen plays multiple clips
    of different things, such as floating, sneezing, tripping, plants, and more. The more you move your mouse, the more the vidoes become distorted.
    Alongside all these topics of choice, you can check out the news of it, the gender balance, the videos, and the words. Those are just the
    start of this immense website with every click and movement doing something interesting, the most intersting part however, is the timer.
    This timer is based on the average year life excpectancy of your area. Mine was 74.5 years, so it gave me 7 minutes and 45 seconds to use
    the website before shutting down and telling me to come back in 24 hours so I can live my life. An effective way to get me off the chair!</p>

     <p> This seems like a good way to protect myself on Facebook. Plus the webste is really funny with all the check box modes you can do with your mouse!
    I like the idea of having a language that the bots and algorithm on facebook cannot read. It reminds me of alien languages that are difficult
    to make out in a film. Plus, the website that you can download the chrome extension is filled with cool features, such as examples of the 
    extension and check boxes in the top left that let you mouse do cool things. This includes multiplying, streaks, and even a flashlight mode for the 
    entire page. Overall this was a fun website.</p>

    <p> Okay this one needs to be played to the fullest. Seems really fun! The mouse and keyboard are the most important tools here, and they help guide along 
    the adventure. There is an astounding amount of nicely made art. I am confused by the game screen of the experiments menu, as it has you combine piss,
    spit, or tears together as many times as you wish for an undisclosed ammount of time. Its confusing but I think I might get the point of it later on.
    Hopefully I'll finish playing the game over time and understand its full meaning. The story of a woman joining the ranks of strange and threatening 
    scientists is interesting, so if I find a way to get past the experiment levels, I would love to see where the story goes.</p>

    <p> I worked in a flower shop once, and it was quite the experience. I delivery drove and helped around the story whenever I could. One thing that was 
    always nice was the flowers themselves, to see how the arrangments would be created and would light up a place. Handling them could be diffciult,
    but there was a joy in the work of flowers. Seeing so many different flowers in alphabet form, with information regarding their conditions,
    harvest times, and some fun facts, this is a website that is pretty cool to look at. Peaceful too, with its font choices and classical art styles.
    I could also buy prints of the letters on the website, a very welcome addition to my collection of art prints.</p>
